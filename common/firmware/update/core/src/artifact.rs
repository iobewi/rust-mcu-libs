//! Streaming write of one artifact's bytes: accepts data in any chunking,
//! tracks *received* (accepted into this session) separately from *durable*
//! (the backend's own watermark, from [`crate::storage::ArtifactStorage`]),
//! and hashes exactly the bytes that have become durable -- never bytes
//! merely received, and never by re-reading them back from storage.
//!
//! That distinction is the one invariant this module exists to hold: after
//! a dropped connection, only `durable` bytes are known to still be there,
//! so a resumed stream must continue from `durable`, never from `received`
//! (which can run ahead of it by however much the backend was still
//! holding, unflushed, at the moment things stopped). A [`WriteSession`]
//! itself is never reconstructed from a `durable` watermark alone -- its
//! digest lives only in its own live hasher, so "resuming" only ever means
//! a caller keeping the *same* session across chunks; see
//! [`WriteSession::begin`]'s own doc comment for what that implies about
//! surviving a process restart (it doesn't, by design, same as the proven
//! code this was extracted from).
//!
//! Nothing here knows what a "sector" is: [`crate::storage::ArtifactStorage`]
//! decides, on every call, how much of what it's offered it can make
//! durable right now, and this module keeps whatever it didn't take (the
//! *pending* tail) in RAM until the backend says otherwise.
//!
//! That backend is not trusted on faith to keep its side of this: every
//! `write`/`finish` reply is checked, as a real, non-optimized-out error
//! ([`Error::InvalidDurabilityReport`]), against
//! `old_durable <= new_durable <= old_durable + pending.len()`. A backend
//! that never advances `durable` at all is legal -- `pending` then grows,
//! but only up to `total` (bounded by the same check `append` already
//! makes on `received`), never past it and never without bound.
